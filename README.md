# static-timesheet
Single page dummy timesheet that is meant to organize my workday in a healthier manner.
Its more of an experiment, but later I took it more seriously, as you can see below, its quite steep to stick to this timesheet for messy WFH guy, but after ~2 weeks I now stick to this timesheet ~60-75% of the time, which is better than the mess I had in my life before.
I learnt a lot while building the code little by little with my personal teacher "ChatGPT", not the greatest one, but for a hobbey pusuer serves well as a personal tutor.

## TODO
- [ ] Tiny Docker image based on minimal Apline with uhttpd
- [ ] Edit items Add/remove
- [ ] Notifications
- [ ] Auth and multi user support

## Deployment options
1. GitHub pages
2. Cloudflare Workers/Pages
3. Possibly other free static site hosters
4. Or maybe your own server

## Selfhosted
Probably the most joyful part in making this was the selfhosting of gitea instance, with jenkins instance, its rewarding feeling for someone who's not doing it for a job :) 

## Disclaimer
Sadly, As an Electrical Engineer, I have zero experience in the field of personal fitness and very basic in coding, I built it for fun "selfhosting" and in hope I get more fit without wasting much time dedicated only for that goal.
